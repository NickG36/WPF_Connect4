This project is still work in progress.
I am developing a WPF GUI that allows you to play Connect 4 against the computer.
The plan is to have a 'best move calculator' which works on an abstract board type, which is independant of the game's details.
A concrete board needs understand the different types of piece and how to make moves, and a different one can be used to play
chess instead, for instance.
The GUI itself will need to be tailored to the game though.
